= How is it better than pluggin X for browser Y? =

Broser extensions are great, but they are broser-specific by definition. "f5" is broser-independent, which is usually very important if you're a web designer.


= Why the monitored page is sometimes reloaded and sometimes just "updated"? =

The page doesn't need to be reloaded if only CSS has changed. "f5" applies updated CSS by dynamically inserting it into a new style tag (at the end of the head tag). This way it works faster and causes less "flickering".
